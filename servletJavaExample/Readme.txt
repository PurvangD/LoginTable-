The following servletExample is basically a code a login page credentials from the local database. 
If the credentials matches than it will open a form where in you can enter your details and that details would 
again be stored in local datbase. 


For this project I have used
    - Appache Tomcat server 9
    - Core Java Concepts
    - Servlet (XML file) 
    - SQL workbench for storing the data 
    - JDBC concepts 


Make sure that you have a connection to local host. For this project I have used SQL workbench. Will you make an account in the SQL workbench you have to make sure that save the credentials because you need login username most likely it would be root if you don't change it and password.
